          Falcon BMS functions well under ALVR on Plasma 6 Wayland (BMS using XWayland) with a Quest 3 and an RX 7900 XT. GE-Proton10-4 works. You must run the game in windowed mode, as fullscreen crashes on mission load and borderless borks the render resolution and FOV. Copy the game into a Steam generated proton prefix for easy VR support, even if initially installed with Lutris and GOG. Virpil T50CM throttle, WarBRD/T50CM2 stick (firmware 5/30/25), and CH Pro Pedals recognized out of the box. The Alternative Launcher occasionally goes all black, but switching to a different tab or waiting a bit usually fixes it. Weapons Delivery Planner also appears to work using Wine in flatscreen, but I was unable to get Tacview working properly (UI stays all black).
