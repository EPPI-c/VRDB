          On ALVR the game runs perfectly on versions of proton around version 9, but the crossbow has an issue with rendering the scope unless you mess with performance settings, mainly anti aliasing, which fixes it until you restart the game. On WiVRn, it doesn't launch, not on opencomposite or xrizer.
