          At the time I've tested via the WiVRn branch "interaction-profiles", but it is going to be shortly integrated into WiVRn. I have a gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW_K8T1n1Bs
          It doesn't work at all under ALVR

          The game works perfect via ALVR, on my setup (4080, KDE Plasma, latest drivers 570.124.04. It would be also perfect on Wivrn, but I can't get controllers to works. I think it worked on some previous version of Wivrn.
          So for me - stick with ALVR this time.
