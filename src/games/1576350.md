          Works perfectly out of the box. Actually I have this game for a long time now, and proton increasingly improved its compatibility over time, at the time of Proton 5 it wouldn't even play the in-game movies.
          I've made a video showing the differences between this game and the pancake original adapted for VR: https://youtu.be/RC2pHOGPsJA
