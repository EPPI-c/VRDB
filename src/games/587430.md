          Most of the game works fine, with the notable exception of the tutorial failing to detect some inputs on the knuckles controller. Loading a save that's already past the tutorial works fine though.

          Upon trying to start the game with either xrizer or opencomposite, the game fails to create a window or even launch at all, preventing me from playing. Opening it without any headset connected makes the game open fine but with no control due to not having a headset connected.
