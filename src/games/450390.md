          It works mostly as normal and you can play most of the games and everything looks clean, although sometimes it either suffers slowdown or randomly crashes during a game. Also 2 of the games crash each time you try to load them, those being robot repair and secret shop, and loading screens mess up due to it not using steamvr, but thats purely visual. 
          PC is Ethernet wired, 5Ghz network on headset, latest version of wiVRn with envision, and proton version was tested with both GE-Proton8-16 and the latest experimental, and im using the latest drivers for nvidia
