          - Cannot scroll menus
          - Cannot select spells
          - Movement stops when pointing at a map, but you can just start moving again (I don't know if this is intentional)
          Other than that, very good experience.

          Worked perfectly although very resource intensive compared to native Windows for some reason on GEProton9-25. No issues otherwise.
