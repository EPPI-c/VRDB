          Shows the "Until You Fall" logo, then gets stuck on the black screen afterwards.
          Supposedly using the `black-screen-fix` beta may fix it, but that beta seems to not exist anymore.

          Doesn't get past the splash screen with OpenComposite, but gets ingame with xrizer. Right now it seems like it's emulating Vive Wands, but the game is still perfectly playable, and this will most likely be fixed as xrizer matures. Running on 6.13.7 zen kernel, nvidia 570.124, Hyprland, Proton experimental

          Game works fine with SteamVR.
          Using Monado + OpenComposite the game does not launch.
          With xrizer the game launched initially but after that xrizer crashed every time.

          Start properly with a proper VR black loading screen, and quickly crash to desktop after a few seconds.
