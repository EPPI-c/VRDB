          Last week, I was able to get the UEVR injector working with Oblivion Remastered.
          Steps:
              Download the dotnet 6 package
              Install it with the command prefixes
              WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/2623190/pfx WINEFSYNC=1 ~/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/GE-Proton9-27/files/bin/wine windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.36-win-x64.exe
              Launch Steam
              Launch Steam VR
              Launch Oblivion Remastered
              Launch UEVR injector
              WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/2623190/pfx WINEFSYNC=1 ~/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/GE-Proton9-27/files/bin/wine UEVRInjector.exe
          This worked great last week.
          This week this does not work at all
