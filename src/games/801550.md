          Runs pretty much perfectly.
          Controller bindings are a little broken:
          - Trigger Touch is mapped like Trigger Pull. That is, touching the trigger curls the index finger all the way in and fires the held gun, or clicks the menu.
          - Other bindings seem correct.
          Menus seem to "tear" sometimes, looks like rapid flickers of empty space.

          So, it works, but there are some issues with the control inputs which are either, badly explained, or set for the Index which will require some rebinding. And there's some tearing in-game which will make the experience pretty annoying for such a fast game.
