          Runs pretty much perfectly.
          Controller bindings are a little broken:
          - Trigger Touch is mapped like Trigger Pull. That is, touching the trigger curls the index finger all the way in and fires the held gun, or clicks the menu.
          - Other bindings seem correct.
          Menus seem to "tear" sometimes, looks like rapid flickers of empty space.
