          Game will launch, will track headset and play audio, but no video displayed on headset. Video does show on the desktop window. Controllers do not appear to be tracking in the desktop view window. Attempted with both OpenCompoosite and xrizer

          Works perfectly on SteamVR/ALVR.
          Does not work on OpenComposite (game does not launch due to a race condition, after patching around this the controller input is completely messed up). Works on WiVRn using VapoR except loading screen does not display.
