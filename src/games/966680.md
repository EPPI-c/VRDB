          Fatal Error upon launch with either OpenComposite or xrizer (no crash without either of them running, but then it only shows on the desktop ofc).
          Crash was resolved by switching to Proton 7.0.6 as suggested on ProtonDB.
          Now it starts but does not seem to connect to monado, it only shows on the desktop (not in the HMD), and it does not show reaction to controller or HMD tracking either.
          None of the alternative debugging steps (e.g. launch options) changed that.
          Same behaviour for OpenComposite and xrizer.
