          Fatal Error upon launch with either OpenComposite or xrizer (no crash without either of them running, but then it only shows on the desktop ofc).
          Crash was resolved by switching to Proton 7.0.6 as suggested on ProtonDB.
          Now it starts but does not seem to connect to monado, it only shows on the desktop (not in the HMD), and it does not show reaction to controller or HMD tracking either.
          None of the alternative debugging steps (e.g. launch options) changed that.
          Same behaviour for OpenComposite and xrizer.

          Following recommendations found on ProtonDB, I switched back to Proton 8 and added "-dx11" to the command line arguments (otherwise game would open as a black screen and a fatal error message box would pop up). After these changes, game runs completely fine.

          Orientation of the knuckles controller is wrong, making movement awkward. Had to use Proton 8 instead of Proton 9 to get the game running.
