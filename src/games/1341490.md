          Terrible performance on RTX 4070, less than 20 FPS and huge input lag. Works perfectly on Win10 on the same PC.

          Worked perfectly out of the box, in both OpenXR mode and OpenVR mode (with OpenComposite), though sometimes it fails to connect with OpenComposite in OpenVR mode and there's just a short blip of black in monado but it never ends up connecting.
          The default control scheme was different in each mode as far as I can tell:
          OpenVR Mode (using OpenComposite+monado) without the Index Controller emulation defaulted to teleport on the joysticks.
          OpenXR Mode (directly using monado) defaulted to the jump/warp on the joysticks.
          You'll likely want the OpenXR mode anyway, seems to be well-implemented in this game.
          OpenVR mode with xrizer had faulty control scheme / missing hands, and location issues.
          Also seems quite optimised, was playable at 60% renderscale on a 780M iGPU.
