          This one was a tough nut to crack. Even on Windows it is riddled with technical mishaps. For starters, if I just run it unprepared, Steam says my headset is incompatible and asks me if I really want to run.
          With both WiVRN stable (24.0.3, I think) and ALVR stable and Proton 9.0-4, it shows Vive Wands on the screen and asks you to press the back triggers. It is unresponsive to these controls though, it just won't proceed.
          I was able to run it with the following adjustments:
          WIVRN: v0.24.1-13-g041e37c with the equivalent APK on the headset.
          STEAM: set game properties → general → launch parameters to be `%command% -HMD=OpenXR` (this will change the initial screen from vive wands to Oculus Touch controllers and hopefully these will register)
          PROTON: Proton 9.0-4 runs the game, but it won't play the in-game movies, so you have to use an alternative that runs microsoft-compatible codecs. I was able to run the in-game movies by using GE-Proton9-26.
          If you tried first with different settings or protons, remove the game's proton prefix (`.../steamapps/compatdata/2806890`) before each new attempt (it repopulates this directory when you launch).
          I couldn't make it to run under ALVR, only the latest WiVRn with opencomposite. Also tried WiVRn with xrizer but the controls wouldn't register.
          It is of note that the hands on the game appear in a wrong angle. But the game is still playable.
          Apparently there's no smooth turning, only snap turning.
