          Works by using latest WiVrn with Xrizer, and Envision for all the setup
          Controllers did not work previously with OpenComposite, but work now
          Only issue : the controller prompts are replaced with ⚠️ but do work

          SteamVR - works perfectly, there used to be a lot of bugs on Linux in general but as of February 2025 I don't see any issues (except usual SteamVR shenanigans)
          Monado/OpenComposite - controller prompts are replaced with a warning sign but still work, on Vive Wands you're forced to use the default controller bindings, and trackpads don't work so I'm unable to turn around.

          Works out of the box - seems to perform really well on my setup via WiVRn.

          No controller glyphs issues with the Valve Index despite previous reports, at least for me. The game does suffer from degraded performance, but it can just be addressed via the graphic settings.

          Works perfectly with ALVR.
          WiVRn mostly works but when entering a ship, cannot grab the throttle with the left hand or use the left hand exit.  Right hand works to grab the stick and door.  Left hand works outside of the ship, pressing the grip curls the fingers and toggles the scanner as it is supposed to.  This is a game breaking bug because you can't really play if you can't fly ships.  Tried with both WiVRn 0.19 and 0.23 - same issue.
