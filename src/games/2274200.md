          As reported on protondb, you need to copy two OpenCL.dlls from the windows/system32 and windows/syswow64 directories of a windows install (hope you have one) into the compatdata/2274200/pfx/drive_c/windows/system*** directories.
          After that, smooth sailing with OpenComposite.
          With xrizer seems to work too, but joystick input is not recognised, probably specific to HP Reverb G2.
