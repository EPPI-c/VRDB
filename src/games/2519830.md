          Linux Native version is outdated and unmaintained, make sure to switch to forcing Proton. 
          With Proton 9 it worked fine, i didnt test anything else.
          Besides that, Mirrors seemed to be broken. Each eye getting a different image and causing really messed up visuals. Like double vision basically.  To fix add OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 to your launch options. This fixes mirrors. 
          After both those little fixes, everything worked nicely without a single issue so far.

          Running this on Wayland via Envision, works perfectly, including with RML and Monkeyloader mods
          I am using the Proton version with Proton GE-RTSP, the native Linux build is considered deprecated

          Monado seems to be a bit better than SteamVR, but the game is very unoptimised.
          Also use the windows version using proton, since the linux native version runs worse.

          Linux Native build exists, but is unmaintained - had to force Proton. Otherwise works perfectly fine for me.
