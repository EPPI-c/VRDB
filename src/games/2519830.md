          Linux Native version is outdated and unmaintained, make sure to switch to forcing Proton. 
          With Proton 9 it worked fine, i didnt test anything else.
          Besides that, Mirrors seemed to be broken. Each eye getting a different image and causing really messed up visuals. Like double vision basically.  To fix add OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 to your launch options. This fixes mirrors. 
          After both those little fixes, everything worked nicely without a single issue so far.
