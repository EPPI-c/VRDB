          SteamVR:
          Works out of the box
          Monado:
          At startup it complains that it cant read `application_generated_unity_sweetsurrender_exe_binding_holographic_controller.json`
          at `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Sweet Surrender VR/Sweet Surrender VR_Data/StreamingAssets/SteamVR/`
          My solution to this was to just copy the valve index file and rename the copy to the file it wants and then the game launches fine.
          There is 1 minor graphical glitch, but it's not big enough to change the category of the rating for imo, when loading a level the black screen seems to not span the entire visual area and instead is only partly in the middle of your vision. On steamvr its fully black gives a lagspike and then the level is loaded, so its not that big of a deal honestly, no further issues when the level is actually loaded.

          The game refuses to run unless you give it the correct mapping for the halo controllers. This is not a problem as pointed out by sbot50, copying and renaming the meta controller .json file in the requested folder into `application_generated_unity_sweetsurrender_exe_binding_holographic_controller.json` solved the problem completely. After that it ran as expected.
