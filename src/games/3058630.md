          Various visual glitches occur after a while, as though the game were reading from the wrong textures, many objects taking on trippy colors. These issues happen on AMD GPUs and are not specific to VR (Windows users also report visual issues on AMD GPUs, but those artifacts are not as distracting as the ones we get when using the RADV drivers).
          The game crashes when the headset loses tracking (I can consistently get the game to crash by simply putting my hand in front of the base station). If careful about avoiding this, it is possible to have long play sessions without crashes.
