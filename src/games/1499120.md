          Trying to use proton 10.0-1 on Catchyos with kernel 6.15.2-2-catchyos in this game causes it to either "stick" any inputs on an object, making it nigh impossible to progress with anything unless you constantly open up the meta menu to unstick the controllers, it also makes it so where any brushing against an object causes the controllers vibrations to go full throttle for a few seconds. Tried with both xrizer and opencomposite. NVIDIA Proprietary driver 575.57.08.
