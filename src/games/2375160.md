          Framerate is very low and unstable, especially considering it's a DOOM engine game.
          Controllers are positioned incorrectly.
          HUD needs to be adjusted in the settings to become visible.
          Controller bindings are odd, but usable.
          - Buttons do pause, interact, escape. I forget the layout because it's odd.
          - Grip does weapon switching.
          - Trigger fires held weapon.
