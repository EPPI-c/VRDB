          SteamVR works out-of-the-box but has occasionally strong performance degradation as opposed to Windows, which I've noticed in other Unity-based games.
          Monado/OpenComposite - you're unable to do anything once you get to the main menu - walk, turn around, interact with menus.

          Plays perfectly, controllers work fine, and there's no floating white box since recently
