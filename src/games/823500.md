          SteamVR works out-of-the-box but has occasionally strong performance degradation as opposed to Windows, which I've noticed in other Unity-based games.
          Monado/OpenComposite - you're unable to do anything once you get to the main menu - walk, turn around, interact with menus.

          Plays perfectly, controllers work fine, and there's no floating white box since recently

          Really, no issues in-game with the game personally in Monado. Grabbing included.

          Game seems to play fine, except that when using slowmo button, the player is forced to jump, which breaks many tricks and generally ruins the gameplay experience.

          No particular issue (I saw another report discussing the difference with Windows performance, but I've only played on Linux so I don't have a reference point).
