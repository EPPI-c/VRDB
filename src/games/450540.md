          Works once on opencomposite, errors after every other launch
          on xrizer, the game is playable, but controllers are offset

          Both Monado and SteamVR - works out-of-the-box but performance is significantly worse as opposed to Windows, same issue as Boneworks.

          Both Monado and SteamVR perform similarly. Works great without no issues that I could find.

          Tested with both OpenComposite and XRizer,  OpenComposite works near flawlessly except for the lack of IMU data passthrough, making revolvers impossible to close. Under xrizer, everything seems to work flawlessly. 
          Using Proton 9.0-4 as compatibility layer, used the following launch parameters in attempt to reduce stuttering, seems to have worked but haven't done much A/B testing with them. 
          `PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 WINE_CPU_TOPOLOGY=4:0,1,2,3 %command% `
