          The game with the UEVR Mod works perfectly via WiVRn.
          Versions used: 
          WiVRn v0.24.1
          Mesa 25.0.4
          kernel 6.14.2-273-tkg-eevdf
          UEVR 1.05
          Instructions:
          -  Installed the download dotnet6 on the game's prefix: protontricks-launch --no-bwrap --appid 399810 --no-background-wineserver /tmp/windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.36-win-x64.exe
          - Started WiVRN, connected to the headset
          - Started the game, started a new game in it to control the character
          - Copied uevr uncompressed to the game's prefix directory: `/home/patola/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1129580/pfx/drive_c/uevr/`
          - Ran the UEVR injector: `protontricks-launch --no-bwrap --appid 399810 --no-background-wineserver /home/patola/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1129580/pfx/drive_c/uevr/UEVRInjector.exe`
          - Selected [x] OpenXR, then INJECT
          - Waited until it appeared in the headset, chose some option and started the game
