          I played this game all the way through using SteamVR. I used a standard Proton version so no GE or any other kind. I've not tested anything else, but I had zero problems using SteamVR with Proton 9.0. The full game ran flawlessly, with no tinkering required. I had no hiccups or strange frame drops either. It was all smooth as butter.
