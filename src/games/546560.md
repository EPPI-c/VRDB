          Works well on OC, but the A and X buttons cause you to snap turn right and left respectively, and i'm not sure if you can change that
          game does not function well on xrizer, hands are horribly offset and thumbsticks do nothing

          Works 100% fine IF you use the following OpenComposite git branch : https://gitlab.com/OrionMoonclaw/OpenOVR/-/tree/priorities to fix the A and X buttons (use Envision to easily switch branch)
          Xrizer currently has issues with hands

          Has the occasional issues between the native Linux version and Proton ran one detecting the headset or SteamVR process, but that might be a bit out of this report. The game doesn't run at all with Monado however, sadly. Crash with asking a SteamVR process at start.

          Controller issues make the game unplayable. I haven't tried the dedicated branch of opencomposite.

          No controller issues with the index (using the native build of Alyx).

          ALVR was functional but had an issue with displaying the game too brightly.
          WiVRn worked much better, streamed very clearly. There was a controller issue at first where the left and right lower face buttons cause the view to rotate 90 degrees; difficult to work with as those buttons also serve a gameplay purpose when holding the pistol or syringe. This was fixed by downloading and compiling the latest version of XRizer  (v0.2 at time of writing) and adding it to the launch options as VR_OVERRIDE=/home/<myhomedirectory>/xrizer/target/release/ . Now it works fantastically, best way to play the game on Linux so far!
