          Works well on OC, but the A and X buttons cause you to snap turn right and left respectively, and i'm not sure if you can change that
          game does not function well on xrizer, hands are horribly offset and thumbsticks do nothing

          Works 100% fine IF you use the following OpenComposite git branch : https://gitlab.com/OrionMoonclaw/OpenOVR/-/tree/priorities to fix the A and X buttons (use Envision to easily switch branch)
          Xrizer currently has issues with hands

          Has the occasional issues between the native Linux version and Proton ran one detecting the headset or SteamVR process, but that might be a bit out of this report. The game doesn't run at all with Monado however, sadly. Crash with asking a SteamVR process at start.

          Controller issues make the game unplayable. I haven't tried the dedicated branch of opencomposite.
