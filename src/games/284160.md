          VR session ends immediately after starting, no error message in the logs (just "Disabling OpenXR" right after enabling it). This is using the native Linux build of BeamNG.drive 0.34.

          Everything worked with correctly configured WiVRn environment using envision. You may be able to get the proton version to work, but its easier to use the linux native build by `cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/BeamNG.drive/BinLinux` and then launching the game with `PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wivrn/comp_ipc:/var/lib/flatpak/app/io.github.wivrn.wivrn ./BeamNG.drive.x64`.
          Once the game is open you can enable VR mode in display settings like normal and if WiVRn is running it should start streaming to the headset. The game uses OpenXR for its VR Implementation fyi.
