          Crashed because of missing hpmotioncontroller.json file. Copied (with minor modifications) from Moss: Book II and stopped crashing.
          Sadly, with monado+OpenComposite it is only black and never connects to the headset.
          With monado+xrizer it does show up in the headset, but neither controller shows up and works, making it impossible to get past the "Seated Experience" screen.

          Running with ALVR worked out of the box.

          The game doesn't work properly with WiVRn + OpenComposite. It does boot, but it doesn't show up on the headset and the controls do not work. The initial "this is a seated experience" screen cannot be dismissed.
          WiVRn + xrizer makes the game playable without many issues.
          Attempting to open the controls settings menu crashes the game, with xrizer throwing a "this method is not implemented" error.
