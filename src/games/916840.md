          SteamVR/ALVR Works but has poor performance as most games via SteamVR do.
          With Monado/WiVRn, OpenComposite crashes, but xrizer does boot.
          Unfortunately, the controllers don't seem to work properly. There's a prompt to reset your HMD view (which is usually done by clicking in right stick); I can get past it by pushing the R key on the keyboard, but I cant use controllers in the menu still, effectively leaving me softlocked.
          Performance already seems great and promising just from the menus, but I can't actually start anything. I opened an issue [here](https://github.com/Supreeeme/xrizer/issues/149).
