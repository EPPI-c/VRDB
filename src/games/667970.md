          This was with GEProton9-25
          Worked perfectly out of the box - in ALVR I had to keep switching my bitrate and resolution settings until I found a sweetspot but that would apply to all games. Once that was set I managed to load into a mission, fly around for 1 hour, played custom songs, played workshop missions, no issues whatsoever
          Even had GPU Screen Recorder on and that recorded my viewport completely OK.
