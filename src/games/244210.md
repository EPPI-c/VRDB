          Severe performance issues with SteamVR/ALVR. Recommend using WiVRn or Monado.
          Linux native version does not support the mod, so the Windows version must be used. To force the Windows version, simply select a Proton version under Game Properties・Compatibility.
          Proton version used for testing: GE-Proton9-16
          Launch options (required to activate mod):
          When launching the game, select PlayValheim and not the Vulkan option!
          Mesa: 24.3.4
          Kernel: 6.13.3-gentoo-dist
          Use OpenComposite 1.0.1459 or later. Not tested with XRizer.
          (If the quick select wheel doesn't work, your OC version is too old.)
