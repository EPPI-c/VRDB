          Game works. But performance is REALLY BAD until it's set at the lowest possible. Then it's playable with random frame drops.

          Flawless with both ALVR and WiVRn, works better for me than on Windows in fact.

          Worked out of the box with Proton 9.0-4 and experimental in SteamVR
          Does slightly stutter when loading into a new map for the first time but will go away after a while when the map is fully loaded.
