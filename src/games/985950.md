          With WiVRn, using Proton 9.0 it won't start with a DirectX11 error; with Proton 8 or 10, it kind of starts but does not initialize VR and keeps loading eternally. So it's unplayable.
          With ALVR, it works correctly all the way with no issues, it even recognizes the haptic controllers and allows playing with them.
