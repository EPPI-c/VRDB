          So, it works. Very long load times, but it might be on me. Grabbing cubes works too, and is working well.
          To want to note, the VR version saves are compatible with the main game, but not the way around. It use an older version of the desktop version of the game. Worth pointing out for double owners.

          No VR Device detected on Linux Native Version with both OpenComposite and xrizer.
          So I used Proton to force it to run the Windows version and that launched it just fine with OpenComposite (after warning me about by graphics driver version which I could dismiss). Sadly, right controller doesn't show up. Nothing at all with xrizer, just desktop mode.
          Have not tried playing without  the right controller.
