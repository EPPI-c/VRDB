          Ran fine, but requires perfect tracking and room calibration to work as the game does not offer an option to recenter.
          Wlx-OverlayS is heavily recommended to drag the playspace around you.
          Even then, using basalt tracking on a WMR headset, the tracking shifted over time and it was overal too unreliable to trust, as a common tracking failure would get you killed, and the slow drift would make you run into things. With great tracking probably an enjoyable experience.
