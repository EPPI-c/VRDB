          Works perfectly with openmv-vr (an open-source engine for morrowind), gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxZkffnsj50
          Please notice that for many months, probably more than a year, openmw-vr wasn't compilable on Linux but it was not fixed as of this report (2025-06-15). This means the game runs on Linux natively, NOT via proton.
          To play the game:
          1 - install morrowind from Steam. Run it once just to ensure it works.
          2 - install openmw-vr from your distro's repo. Run it once.
          3 - Edit `~/.config/openmw/openmw.cfg` and point it to where your `Morrowind/Data Files` are, e.g. 
          `data="/games/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Morrowind/Data Files"`
          4 - use these launch options on Steam for morrowind: `cmd=(%command%); /usr/bin/openmw_vr`
          5 - star WiVRn (I suggest to do it via envision), connect
          6 - press play on morrowind.
