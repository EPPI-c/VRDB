          Seems to only work with Proton 8. The mod only supports SteamVr and the game does not start with monado. Also the NomaiVR FFR mod crashes the game. To uninstall you need to verify steam files. Once you get in the game the experience is pretty smooth. (Except that reprojection doesn't work in nixos steamvr)

          I am running it via Proton 6.3. It works perfectly well via ALVR. Works on Wivrn, but it is a little more jittery.
