          Server gets spammed with:
          ```
          WARN [wait_semaphore] Waiting on client semaphore value '1' timed out > 100ms!`
          ```
          The game never fully starts and just sits on a black screen.

          Works nearly perfectly, hovering over menu options and putting your finger on the capacitive sensor will count as clicking though, in game gunplay works fine and stable.

          I recorded test gameplay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19KX3ZmXvkA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeIWFnPH75U). 
          What I got were really bad stutters/freezes/disconnections every 10-30 seconds (both display and controllers), with great performance in between: perfect latency and clarity/resolution. Also, there's a bug in the menus where only touching the trigger registers as a click instead of actually pulling the trigger, as yayameowmeow mentioned. Arguably the performance is not usable, but it still boots and runs, I would just suggest using ALVR instead until it improves.
