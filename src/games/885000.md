          works 99% out of the box, including custom song support.
          only thing that didn't work was recentering the playspace, but I fear that is a setup-specific issue as that exists with other games in my library

          Works perfectly.  Custom songs great.  ALVR occasionally has latency/lag which can cause a miss.  Prefer WiVRn for rhythm games.
