          Similar to I Expect You To Die 2, the controller stickiness comes back in this game as well. However, this is the worst case of it yet, making you only have 1 of each gesture to use before you have to fully tab out the window and tab back in to give you one more try, Trying to use the Meta menu to fix it wont work anymore. Also, the harsh vibration bug is back as well, making it a bane for battery powered controllers. Tried on both XRizer and opencomposite, Proton Experimental, NVIDIA Proprietary driver 575.57.08.
