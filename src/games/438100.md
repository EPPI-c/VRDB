          Works pretty much perfectly.
          Non-16:9 videos on video players (at least ProTV3) are stretched, while on Windows they are letterboxed. Not sure if this is a Unity issue.
          Running OS+VRChat on an HDD results in EAC errors, probably due to a speed bottleneck. Moving to an SSD resolved it for me.
          ToNSaveManager also works well when run with ProtonTricks (FlatPak `com.github.Matoking.protontricks`) in the VRChat prefix. (May need to set flatpak permissions to allow it access to the `ToNSaveManager.exe`)
          I use `flatpak run --command=protontricks-launch com.github.Matoking.protontricks --appid 438100 ./ToNSaveManager.exe` to run it, plus `notify-send` to tell me when my launch script runs (since it takes a while to launch) and if it stops.

          Works flawlessly. The loading screens are kinda odd since both the "Loading" text and preview image are just of to the side stacked on top of each other and not angled right, but it doesnt affect anything at all, you can still read if its loading or connecting, you can still play the Game just fine. It just looks kinda odd.

          Works basically flawlessly using Proton-GE-rtsp and OpenComposite. Haven't tried XRizer much, but from my usage it's seemed flawless for me. Documentation for setup on NixOS is pretty good, too. Nixpkgs overlays such as nixpkgs-xr for nightly builds of XR packages like Monado, Wlx-Overlay-s, Wayvr-Dashboard and others exist and makes it feel truly cutting edge. Performance is excellent with AMD only hardware 7900XTX and 5800x3D. Video players cause performance dips, but that's to be expected. Assuming 60fps, it will probably dip by about 10fps when looking at it or when it's active. FBT works flawlessly as long as STEAMVR_LH_ENABLE is set in the Monado environment.
          Overall very nice experience.
