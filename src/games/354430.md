          It works perfectly via WiVRn with XWVM, a revitalized alternative engine for X-Wing. Please note: the engine offers Linux and Windows ports, but only the Windows port has VR (it's written in Unity so that's a technical limitation of that engine), so you have to run it via proton. Gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwjm7lcOuY4
          Note that it doesn't use the VR controls for more than the menus. To play the game you'll need joystick or mouse + keyboard, it has very complicated controls.
          XWVM can be downloaded from here: https://www.moddb.com/mods/xwvm/news/xwvm-release-announcement
          To install: 
          1 - Install and run X-Wing once on Steam just to ensure it's working with Proton.
          2 - run the XWVM's installer via protontricks on your X-Wing prefix (`protontricks 354430 --gui`).
          3 - change X-Wing launch options to:
          `cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="/games/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/354430/pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/XWVM/xwvm.exe"; "${cmd[@]}"`
          Where this `cmd[-1]` should point to your actual `xwvm.exe`, of course (location on the default prefix would be `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/354430/pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/XWVM/xwvm.exe`)
          4 - Start WiVRN (I highly advise to run it through envision), connect
          5 - start the game, it will still be in pancake mode
          6 - go to the settings, on camera, enable VR mode.
          7 - This configuration will stick, so next time you launch the game it should already be in VR.
