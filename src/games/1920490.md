          Works perfectly out of the box. Video showing the game on UEVR:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIM_2x-u6nE
          Detailed instructions:
          I used this plugin in UEVR for the controls and adjustments: https://github.com/gwizdek/OuterWorlds-UEVR-Plugin
          Versions:
          WiVRn v25.6.1
          Mesa 25.1.4
          kernel 6.15.4-273-tkg-eevdf
          UEVR 1.05
          * To make it work:
          -  install the game on Steam, run it once and configure on high or medium- download UEVR, uncompress it. Then copy its directory under the game prefix, e.g. cp -r uevr ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1622910/pfx/drive_c/
          - download the UEVR profile, a zip file. Don't uncompress nor rename it.
          - download .NET 6.0 from Microsoft's site and install it on the prefix, say .net is under /dados: PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW="/dados:/home" protontricks-launch --no-bwrap --appid 1920490 /dados/windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.36-win-x64.exe (the PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW is needed so that proton can see the executable file)
          - if you used the variable, you might also want to use it on your steam launch options, so that the game can fully access all files: PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW="/dados:/home" %command%
          - run the game again. Then run the command for UEVRInjector: PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW="/dados:/home" protontricks-launch --no-bwrap --appid 1622910 ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1622910/pfx/drive_c/uevr/UEVRInjector.exe
          - go to "Import"- find the UEVR profile. Import the file. Quit the game and UEVR.
          - start wivrn, connect to it. Start the game. DON'T LOAD A SAVEGAME, for me it crashes every time if I inject after starting playing. I have to inject on the title screen.
          - Run UEVR again, then click on "Inject". The VR screen should go dark for a few seconds, then appear in all its glory. Click both thumbnails to close UEVR screen and start playing.
